your content.

We reach out to a lot of websites (around 2,000 a day) and have found that roughly 80% of sites will charge a fee.

The amount they charge varies greatly, we've had some sites tell us it's $50 per upload, some say it's $100 and some even say it's $500 (which is crazy).

There isn't a rough guide on how much sites charge, it will vary per niche, however, you'll generally find that the more authoritative the site, the more they will charge.

2. Steal Your Competitor's BackLink

Steps
- Find competitors (search by keywords)(look at organic results)
- paste the URL of competitor into SEMrush and see the amt of backlinks and filter through to see what one's they have.

- Look at Follow links only. Those are the most impactful links the site has.
