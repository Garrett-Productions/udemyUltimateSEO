Creating Content and the Importance 

1. What value does this content provide to the user?

Ex) if I search wireless heasdphones, what do you think google will return?
- things with no grammar errors, extremely high content, well formatted
- This is all high ranking, quality content, we must stand out

------------Content Generation Idea-------------
1. Review competition
- cherry pick their keywords because they've already done it
2. By searching our keywords on google, we can immediately see our competitors websites.
- we can go to their website to see what they arew typing about 
- if we are searching wireless headphones, lets see what articles our competitors are writing about when it comes to wireless Headphones 
- dont reinvent the wheel and check out what is going in with the competition 

IN SEMrush, we can type in our keyword and see under 'Keyword Ideas' that there are 'keyword variations' but also, 'Questions.'

We can see how these keywords are used on their sites and see how else they are linked, and if thios site is selling content you can see exactly what they are selling and run soemthing similar and connect your site in a certain way

THE POINT OF FINDING KEYWORD NICHES IS TO INCREASE TRAFFIC AND SALES

--------------How Long Should Your Content Be?----------
1. Base it on websitesa that are already working
- work out the average length of the top 3 websites
- Pass 10% contigency so we know the whereabouts, if there are 1500 keywords in 1 site, do 10% more 

****Use the tool, Wordcounter.net, search the top 3 competitive sites, click them, copy and paste all 3 main pages content into wordcounter.net
- This is done to measure how long our cxontent should be roughly, if we copy and paste 3 sites like we did, we can see our total wordcount of 2,900 hundred words, that divided by 3,(being 3 websites) is 960..

1 answered.) Avg Length is 960
2 answered.) 1040 is when adding 10%.
Conclusion: Make sure your website content length is at least 1000 words in length.
