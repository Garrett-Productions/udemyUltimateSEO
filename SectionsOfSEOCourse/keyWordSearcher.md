KEYWORD SURFER - Google chrome Extension****

Couple things to note, it's free, there are a few limitations such as:

- It does not allow you to see what keywords a site ranks for, it just provides you to see the search volume data

- Its a dedicated keyword research tool, meaning it has no function to check out what backlinks a website has.
