How many keywords should I target on a page?

The straightforward answer is as many relevant keywords as possible.

The key word in that sentence is 'relevant'.

If you're unsure what keywords are deemed as relevant, a fantastic strategy you can use is to literally Google the keywords you are unsure about and see what webpages Google returns.


If Google returns the same webpages as it did for your other keywords, then that's a strong sign that Google views both keywords as similar in terms of their intent. Meaning, you'll want to target the keywords on the same page.


If you notice Google returns completely different websites, then that's a good indicator that you should not target the keyword on the same page.
