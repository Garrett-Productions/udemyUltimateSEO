SEMRUSH
- we have a 7 day trial 
- we are learning how to navigate through it, filter it down, target specific keywords and see data analytics across the web. We know to download the .csv file or bring over all the keywords from Semrush to our excel document we have to data sift.

1. We dove into going into the keyword yoga mat
1b. we filtered through the results by volume of at least 100 results 

2. We created a Keyword Research Template

2b. This entails searching a keyword, diving into all keyword themes on the side panel of SEMrush, 
    clicking the few that really pertain to us and using these to craft an excel spreadsheet

3. We exported as an .csv or xlsv and copy and pasted those keywords into an excel spreadsheet, broken   down by categories. EX) Towels & travel and made seperate tabs for each keyword 

--Finding Competitors Keywords--

* C&P link address of comp, paste into SEMrush
* Excel Spreadsheet to filter and sort further from multiple sources(master sheet & keyword specific sheets). Eliminate duplicates later for final sort & filter.

Rinse and Repeat
