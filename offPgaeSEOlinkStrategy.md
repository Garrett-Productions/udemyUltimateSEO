We reach out to a lot of websites (around 2,000 a day) and have found that roughly 80% of sites will charge a fee.

The amount they charge varies greatly, we've had some sites tell us it's $50 per upload, some say it's $100 and some even say it's $500 (which is crazy).

There isn't a rough guide on how much sites charge, it will vary per niche, however, you'll generally find that the more authoritative the site, the more they will charge.

- check the DA of the site to see if you really want to get a back link
- even though the DA is a 19, but the page is on the first page of google search, just be careful on the anchor text you use. Its a powerful method to find out what keywords and links your competitors have
