SEO HAS 2 MAIN ELEMENTS

~~~~~~~~~WHAT IS SEO AND WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?~~~~~~~~~~~
What is SEO? SEO stands for search engine optimization and is the practice of increasing the quality and quantity of traffic to your website through organic search engine results. Organic traffic is any traffic that you do not pay for.

If I go back to my example I just showed you of a yoga mat, if your business provides yoga mats, but your website does not show up for a search of yoga mats, then you're missing out on a ton of sales. While paid advertising, social media and other online platforms generate traffic to websites, the majority of online traffic is driven by search engines. On top of that, organic search results cover more digital real estate, appear more credible to savvy searchers, and receive way more clicks and paid advertisements. For example, of all US searches, only 2.8% of people clicked on paid advertisements. That statement alone should tell you why and how important SEO is.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~KEYWORD RESEARCH~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* A keyword is a search phrase 
- what are your customers searching in google? target those words, and optimize your website

Keyword intent 
- Buy red yoga mat
**they already know what they need and they want a red yoga mat

When you understand buyer content you can make sure the page person lands in and what the eprson typed in which results of sales

Long term vs Short term keywqords

Short tail: Yoga mat (generic)(search intent is not crystal clear)
Long tail: red non-slip yoga mat under $30(we can generate a more concise match)
- Long tail keywordas are way are targeted and way easier to rank for in google.
- Start with long tail keywords


In the next lecture, I will be showing you a Free keyword research tool called "Google Keyword planner".

Just a quick note to confirm that Googles keyword planner is indeed free to use, however, to use it, you do need to sign up for a Google ads account.

A compulsory part of the sign up process is to enter in your billing details and sometimes create an ad campaign.

I would advise that you literally create any dummy ad campaign just to get past this initial barrier. What's super important to remember, is that as soon as the campaign is created, you want to go into the ads dashboard and PAUSE the campaign so no ads run (and you're not charged).

You can even delete the campaign once its created to be on the safe side.


Option 2: Install a Google tag in your website code
Paste your Google tag before the closing </head> tag on every page of your website you want to track.
Click to copy
<!-- Google tag (gtag.js) -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=AW-11465125585">
</script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());

  gtag('config', 'AW-11465125585');
</script>


Lastly, install an event snippet for each of your goals to measure website conversions

Event snippets help measure usersâ€™ actions based on your conversion goals. You need to set up an event snippet for each goal.

The event snippet works with the Google tag to track actions that should be counted as conversions. Choose whether to track conversions on a page load or click. 
Page load
Add the snippet to the page a customer reaches after completing a conversion
Click
Add the snippet to the page that has a button or a link you'd like to track for clicks
Copy the snippet below and paste it in between the <head></head> tags of the page(s) you'd like to track, right after the Google tag

<!-- Event snippet for Purchase conversion page -->
<script>
  gtag('event', 'conversion', {
      'send_to': 'AW-11465125585/uiicCJzl44UZENHd_9oq',
      'transaction_id': ''
  });
</script>

 
DELETE THE CAMPAIGN

GOOGLE Ads walkthrough

1. We went into tools, and into keyword planner
- from here you can start by "searching with keywords", or "start with a website"
* start with your keywords first and see how beneficial they already are.
* then go back and start with a website and plug in competitors URL's in the start with website that appear from an organic google search of that keyword
-- from here you can see all the relevant keywords that these sites use and sift through the data.
- you can even download the .csv file and do some sifting through all these  keywords to develop a comprehensive list of data

STARTING WITH KEYWORD RESERACH
1. Find out what keywords our websites already appear for in google
(SEMRUSH) - Has all tools built in
- you need to use tools to create your campaign, you need to sift through tons of data before creating a campaign

A CSV is a comma-separated values file, which allows data to be saved in a tabular format. CSVs look like a garden-variety spreadsheet

KEYWORD SURFER - Google chrome Extension****

A couple of things to note, as its a free tool, there are a few limitations such as:

- It does not allow you to see what keywords a site ranks for, it just provides you with search volume data
- Its a dedicated keyword research tool, meaning it has no function to check out what backlinks a website has.


Keryword Difficulty
- MozBar - chrome extension

DELETE THAT
--------------------------------

MOZBAR extension activated shows you PA & DA

* We deep dove into Page Authority and Domain Authority by simply activating our chrome extension and seeing it organically in search results.
- This is important because niche searches like 'non slip yoga mat uk' has a handful of URL's on paghe 1 of google with a PA & DA of under 25, which isn't hard to achieve!

TARGET THAT KEYWORD

SEMRUSH
- we have a 7 day trial 
- we are learning how to navigate through it, filter iut down, target specific keywords and see data analytics across the web. We know to download the .csv file or bring over all the keywords from Semrush to our excel document we have to data sift.

1. We dove into going into the keyword yoga mat
1b. we filtered through the results by volume of at least 100 results 
2. We created a Keyword Research Template
2b. This entails searching a keyword, diving into all keyword themes on the side panel of SEMrush, 
    clicking the few that really pertain to us and using these to craft an excel spreadsheet
3. We exported as an .csv or xlsv and copy and pasted those keywords into an excel spreadsheet, broken   down by categories. EX) Towels & travel and made seperate tabs for each keyword 


----------------FINDING ALL THE KEYWORDS YOUR COMPETITORS RANK FOR------------------------

We are searching through links on our google searches, copy and pasting the "link address" by eright click
and pasting them into SEMrush and finding our competitors keywords, we put them into an excel spreadsheet and that way we can filter and sort them and go into our file explorer and udner "DATA' we can create a filtedr and spread from thaty individual site, and then copy and paste the data over to our master sheet, only the info that is relevant of course!. So now we have an ever-growing excel SEO, keyword research spreadsheet.
- alot of these are duplicates we'll take care of this soon

*Rinse and Repeat Strategy
---- 
So far we've learned how to create a keyword research template, by using SEMrush to find competitors keywords used on their sites, filtering and sorting them down and making a spreadsheet of all the best keywords on an excel spreadsheet, and niching or maximizing according to filter and need
