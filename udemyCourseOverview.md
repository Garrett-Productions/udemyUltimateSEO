~~~~~~~~~WHAT IS SEO AND WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?~~~~~~~~~~~
What is SEO? SEO stands for search engine optimization and is the practice of increasing the quality and quantity of traffic to your website through organic search engine results. Organic traffic is any traffic that you do not pay for.

If I go back to my example I just showed you of a yoga mat, if your business provides yoga mats, but your website does not show up for a search of yoga mats, then you're missing out on a ton of sales. While paid advertising, social media and other online platforms generate traffic to websites, the majority of online traffic is driven by search engines. On top of that, organic search results cover more digital real estate, appear more credible to savvy searchers, and receive way more clicks and paid advertisements. For example, of all US searches, only 2.8% of people clicked on paid advertisements. That statement alone should tell you why and how important SEO is.


KEYWORD RESEARCH
* A keyword is a search phrase 
- what are your customers searching in google? target those words, and optimize your website

Keyword intent 
- Buy red yoga mat
**they already know what they need and they want a red yoga mat

When you understand buyer content you can make sure the page person lands in and what the eprson typed in which results of sales

Long term vs Short term keywqords

Short tail: Yoga mat (generic)(search intent is not crystal clear)
Long tail: red non-slip yoga mat under $30(we can generate a more concise match)
- Long tail keywordas are way are targeted and way easier to rank for in google.
- Start with long tail keywords


In the next lecture, I will be showing you a Free keyword research tool called "Google Keyword planner".

Just a quick note to confirm that Googles keyword planner is indeed free to use, however, to use it, you do need to sign up for a Google ads account.

A compulsory part of the sign up process is to enter in your billing details and sometimes create an ad campaign.

I would advise that you literally create any dummy ad campaign just to get past this initial barrier. What's super important to remember, is that as soon as the campaign is created, you want to go into the ads dashboard and PAUSE the campaign so no ads run (and you're not charged).

You can even delete the campaign once its created to be on the safe side.


Option 2: Install a Google tag in your website code
Paste your Google tag before the closing </head> tag on every page of your website you want to track.
Click to copy
<!-- Google tag (gtag.js) -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=AW-11465125585">
</script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());

  gtag('config', 'AW-11465125585');
</script>


Lastly, install an event snippet for each of your goals to measure website conversions

Event snippets help measure usersâ€™ actions based on your conversion goals. You need to set up an event snippet for each goal.

The event snippet works with the Google tag to track actions that should be counted as conversions. Choose whether to track conversions on a page load or click. 
Page load
Add the snippet to the page a customer reaches after completing a conversion
Click
Add the snippet to the page that has a button or a link you'd like to track for clicks
Copy the snippet below and paste it in between the <head></head> tags of the page(s) you'd like to track, right after the Google tag

<!-- Event snippet for Purchase conversion page -->
<script>
  gtag('event', 'conversion', {
      'send_to': 'AW-11465125585/uiicCJzl44UZENHd_9oq',
      'transaction_id': ''
  });
</script>

GOOGLE Ads walkthrough

1. We went into tools, and into keyword planner
- from here you can start by "searching with keywords", or "start with a website"
* start with your keywords first and see how beneficial they already are.
* then go back and start with a website and plug in competitors URL's in the start with website that appear from an organic google search of that keyword
-- from here you can see all the relevant keywords that these sites use and sift through the data.
- you can even download the .csv file and do some sifting through all these  keywords to develop a comprehensive list of data
